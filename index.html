            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm into investing, skiing, start-ups, the California coastal lifestyle, and, most of all, being a dad. 
                I've built cutting edge products, closed tens of millions in revenue from technology consulting services, built teams, 
                championed industry-changing digital transformation projects, and achieved a couple of patents along the way.
            </p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a revenue operations leader and technologist within the software consulting space. 
                    In short, I thrive on helping companies scale. I have experience leading sales, business operations, staffing, service delivery, PMO leadership, and managing large engineering teams. 
                    Now, I am learning full-stack software development at UC Berkeley.

                        <p>
                            I am focused on helping scale the company. I lead sales, business operations, staffing, service delivery, project management, and engineering. 
                            In 2021 I successfully grew the company from $3M to $20M+, added 30+ key accounts, and grew the engineering team to well over 100 senior-level developers.

                        <p>
                            I work with an amazing team building the next generation performance management tools for software engineering managers. 
                            Skan gives engineering managers mathematically defensible activity metrics, insights, and customized recommendations to optimize developer efficiency, cut-down re-work, and improve throughput. 
                            We use complex algorithms designed to detect meaningful patterns and signals relative to an individual contributor’s activity, engagement, consistency, and efficiency. 
                            This information is distilled down and presented like a FICO® score with clear and actionable insights — helping engineering managers spot behavior changes that may adversely impact productivity.
