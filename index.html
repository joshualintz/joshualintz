                    <p>I'm into investing, skiing, start-ups, the California coastal lifestyle, and, most of all, being a dad. I've built cutting edge products, closed tens of millions in revenue from technology consulting services, built teams, championed industry-changing digital transformation projects, and achieved a couple of patents along the way.</p>
                    <p><a class="btn" href="https://www.honolulu.hawaii.edu/csnt" target="_blank">Check out the CSNT program</a></p>
                    <p>Since graduating, I've been working at Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA) in Honolulu, Hawaii, as a Project Administrator.  In this role, I've managed multiple projects and initiatives related to infrastructure technologies.  Included in these initiatives is a project involving the transition of the entire organization (about 1800 staff and contractors) from Windows 7 to Windows 10.  I managed the scheduling and planning, knowledge production and distribution, and communications related to incidents or general inquiries.  For this project, I leveraged my knowledge of PowerShell to write a script that pulls active users from AD, parses through them, and creates deployment groups of less than 50, grouped by manager.</p>
                    <p>After reading above, it might be curious to some as to why I've made the switch from an infrastructure-based, project role to a more technical, application developer one.  A few factors drive my decision:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A desire to move out of Hawaii</li>
                        <li>A burning interest in coding and development</li>
                        <li>A curiousity to challenge myself with something new.</li>
                        <li>The writing on the wall...</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What I mean by "writing on the wall" is twofold.</p>
                    <p>The first aspect of it is my internal feelings about my skills and aptitudes.  When I was younger, first growing in my knowledge and experience of computers and technology, I began to get this natural sensation of a knack for what I was doing.  Wether it had been helping my parents fix some issue with their computers to troubleshooting my own machines by apparent intuition.  It just came naturally, and I get the same feeling about coding.  I simply <em>get</em> what's going on in the computer and the programs I work with.  Why not dig deeper and start writing them?</p>
                    <p>The second aspect is likely more obvious to everyone: tech is growing.  It's growing in this country, it's growing around the world, and there's a growing need for people who want to code the world into the future.  Aside from my personal interests, I have a bit of altruism in me that wants to put my talent's and affinities to good use.  I have ideas, I have drive, and I want to make everyone's lives easier.  That way we can get back to what we enjoy doing, which isn't figuring out why our application isn't working right.</p>
